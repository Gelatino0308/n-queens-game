# n-queens-game
This "for fun" project will be based on the n-queens problem, which is a generalization of the [eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). It aims to place *n* number of queens in an *n x n* chess board in such a way that each piece won't see each other horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. In this project, I aim to develop a web-app game based on this puzzle to practice my logic and algorithmic understanding. Chess is one of my favorite games, and so I was even more interested to start this project after being introduced to this problem in one of my Computer Science courses.
